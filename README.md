## 📍 Creation process
The idea was to create a profile card that was simple but impactful. I wanted a design that would catch the eye while remaining functional.
- I started with a basic structure in HTML, adding a profile image and essential information.
- Then, I integrated buttons with styles adapted to each social network to reinforce their visual identity.
- To improve interactivity, I added subtle animations on the card and buttons (hover effects and slight transitions).
